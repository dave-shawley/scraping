Web scraping in a few languages
===============================
I needed a quick script to scrape a recipe from 177milkstreet.com into a
simple HTML document.  Their document format is CSS based so I needed
a library that understands HTML and CSS selectors as well as something
to retrieve the contents via HTTP.  I am a Python developer so it was
the first tool that I reached for -- Python + requests + BeautifulSoup.
In about 30 minutes I had a working script.

That is nothing special... *so why this repo?*  I haven't written C++ in
a few years so I wanted to see what web scraping would feel like in a
compiled language.  After locating a library capable of scraping (lexbor),
it really didn't take too long to write something that does the same job.

| Language  | SLOC  | user  | sys   | cpu   | total |
|-----------|:-----:|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Python    | 75    | 0.266 | 0.030 | 75.90%| 0.387 |
| C++       | 395   | 0.037 | 0.010 | 33.46%| 0.135 |

The timings are no where near scientific.  I ran the script 20 times
using zsh's time builtin, dropped the highest and lowest and calculated
the simple average.  Not too mention that this is also subject to the
relative lack of precision in the time built-in.  So make what you will
of the numbers.  Not surprising that a C++ binary is faster and less
resource hungry than a Python script.
